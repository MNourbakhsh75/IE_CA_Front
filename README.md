<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


JobOonja functions as a job-matching platform similar to <a href="https://jooble.org/">Jooble</a> and <a href="https://jobinja.ir/">Jobinja</a>. Employing an auction-based approach, it matches projects to users. Each project in the system specifies the necessary skills and the maximum payment value. Users possessing varying skill levels bid for projects, and ultimately, the system selects the most suitable user for each project.

The project encompassed various phases. The first phase entailed designing and implementing the program logic and back end using <a hre="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/mvc_pattern.htm">MVC design pattern</a>. The second phase involved crafting the front end design using React. A database for data storage with JPA was also designed, and mechanisms such as JWT, Docker, and Kubernetes were employed.

The front end section of the project resides in this repository, containing all the codes, including the HTML, CSS, and JS files. The back end of the project can also be found in <a href="https://github.com/MNourbakhsh75/IE_CA">this repository</a>.
